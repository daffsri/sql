## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

##### Type 1 SCD: Overwriting Changes
When a change is made, the old data is overwritten with the new data. Thereâ€™s no history tracking, and only the most recent version of the data is kept.

CUSTOMER_ADDRESS Table (Type 1 SCD)
Column Name	    Data Type	    Description
address_id	    INT (PK)	    Unique identifier for the address (could be auto-generated).
customer_id	    INT (FK)	    References customer_id from the Customer table.
address_line1	VARCHAR(100)	The first line of the address (street address).
address_line2	VARCHAR(100)	The second line of the address (optional).
city	        VARCHAR(50)	    City of the address.
state	        VARCHAR(50)	    State/Province of the address.
postal_code	    VARCHAR(20)	    Postal/ZIP code of the address.
country	        VARCHAR(50)	    Country of the address.
is_current	    BOOLEAN	        Indicates if this is the current address (TRUE/FALSE).
last_modified	DATETIME	    Timestamp of when the address was last updated.

Explanation:
Type 1 (Overwrite): When a customer changes their address, the old address is replaced by the new address. No new records are created. We simply overwrite the old address in place, maintaining the most recent address without tracking historical changes.
`is_current`: This field could be used to track if the address is currently active. When the customer changes their address, the old address is set to `is_current` = FALSE, until the new address is overwrittem with `is_current` = TRUE, to mark the new address as the current address.
`last_modified`: Tracks when the address was updated.

Use Case for Type 1 (Overwrite):
This model is ideal when the historical address data is not necessary (e.g., if you don't need to know the customerâ€™s past addresses, just the current one). It simplifies data storage and management.

##### Type 2 SCD: Retain Changes

When you want to preserve the history of data. In this case, each change in the customerâ€™s address is treated as a new record, and old records are retained for historical tracking.

CUSTOMER_ADDRESS Table (Type 2 SCD)
Column Name	    Data Type	    Description
address_id	    INT (PK)	    Unique identifier for the address.
customer_id	    INT (FK)	    References customer_id from the Customer table.
address_line1	VARCHAR(100)	The first line of the address (street address).
address_line2	VARCHAR(100)	The second line of the address (optional).
city	        VARCHAR(50)	    City of the address.
state	        VARCHAR(50)	    State/Province of the address.
postal_code	    VARCHAR(20)	    Postal/ZIP code of the address.
country	        VARCHAR(50)	    Country of the address.
start_date	    DATETIME	    Date the address became active.
end_date	    DATETIME	    Date the address was replaced or no longer valid (NULL if the address is current).
is_current	    BOOLEAN	        Indicates if this is the current address (TRUE/FALSE).


Explanation:
Type 2 (Retain History): When a customer updates their address, a new record is inserted into the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table. The start_date is set to the date the address became active, and the end_date is set when the address was superseded (for example, when a new address is added).
`start_date`: This field indicates when the address became active for the customer.
`end_date`: This field records when the address was replaced by a new one (it could be NULL for the current address).
`is_current`: Tracks whether the address is the customer's current address.

Use Case for Type 2 (Retain History):
This model is useful when you need to retain the customerâ€™s full address history, such as in cases where you need to analyze address changes over time (e.g., for shipping purposes, fraud detection, or to understand customer movements). Only one address will have `is_current` = TRUE, representing the most recent address. All previous addresses will have `is_current` = FALSE.

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customerâ€™s visits to the farmerâ€™s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customerâ€™s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customerâ€™s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customerâ€™s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.
